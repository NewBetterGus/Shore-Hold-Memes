# Shore-Hold-Memes
❗WARNING, READ BEFORE USE❗ 
❗not working yet❗
  - The first version has global coordinate systems and is not tied to an arena. Using these commands on the world map will result in movement behind textures. Use only in this arena.

## Setup:
- Copy/paste all .def files from the [protocol folder](https://github.com/PinguinRei/Shore-Hold-Memes/tree/master/defs) to `<path to proxy>\node_modules\tera-data\protocol\`.

## Map
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PinguinRei/Shore-Hold-Memes/master/map/guide.jpg)

## Commands
**Need to be used in _Proxy Channel_ (/proxy) or (/8)**
```
//proxy shbam - Teleport to the BAM spawn!
//proxy shp1 - Teleport to the left pyre!
//proxy shp2 - Teleport to the right pyre!
//proxy shp3 - Teleport to the center pyre!
```

## What to add in the future:
  - auto-update
  - binding to the arena
  - moving underground... you're a bad boy ;) (probably)
